	  Anyone who has worked with electronic components knows how difficult it can get to keep track of the sizes of the various components and how to 
		place them on your board. God forbid you make any mistake in the layout of your PCB board because that spells nothing other than "START AGAIN" 
		for you and your team that may have been working round the clock to design the circuit. The electronic components that can be used on the board 
		come in all shapes and sizes, and trying to memorize their dimensions is just futile because there are so-goddamn-many of them. Now you may think, 
		<br />
		<br />
		<i>"If only there was something that would show all the common components at a glance for easy reference!"</i>
		<br />
		<br />
		Well, here it is. The PCB Ruler - A ruler made using the same material (and process!) that one would use for manufacturing PCBs, but this one 
		contains the outline of common electronic components printed onto the ruler itself!
		<br/>
		It was designed and developed by 
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-r-mhatre-35115113a" target="_blank">Aditya R. Mhatre</a> 
		who introduces this tool as follows:
		<div class="quote">
			A PCB Ruler is the PCB Design reference tool to refer/measuring the various parameters utilised by the hardware layout engineer while designing PCB. 
			The "PCB Ruler itself is a PCB" designed in such way that it will provide the physical understanding of the multiple parameters of the layout like 
			Size of trace, Size of Vias, Size of Drill Holes, Different Passive Component Packages, General ruler for the measurement, PAD pitch etc.
		</div>
		This tool was developed with 4 points in mind:
		<ol>	
			<li>To understand the layout designing parameters physically, before fabrication.</li>
			<li>To cover maximum possible parameters in compact and handy PCB Size/Shape.</li>
			<li>To include a measuring scale, protractor for the angle measurement and the electrical parameters relation as per the Ohm’s Law.</li>
			<li>To make this a 100% "Made In India" product, as it is Conceptualised, Designed, Developed and Fabricated within the country.</li>
		</ol>
	
		Here's the top and bottom sides of the PCB Ruler:

    </div>
		<br />
		Futuristic as heck, isn't it? Exploring sections of the PCB:
		<ol>
			<li>Reference of Trace Width, Drill Size, Via Size (top side):</li>
				<div class="in-article-image-container">
					<img src="/image/tw_ds_vs.jpg" />
				</div>
				<br />
			<li>Reference of RLC (Resistor/Capacitor/Inductor) SMD Packages (top side):</li>
				<div class="in-article-image-container">
					<img src="/image/rlc.jpg" />
				</div>
				<br />
			<li>Reference of Tantalum and Aluminium Capacitors and "Protractor" (top side):</li>
				<div class="in-article-image-container">
					<img src="/image/tc_ac_protractor.jpg" />
				</div>
				<br />
			<li>Reference of Electrical Parameters as per Ohm’s Law and Commonly Used IC Packages (bottom side):</li>
				<div class="in-article-image-container">
					<img src="/image/formula_ICs.jpg" />
				</div>
				<br />
			<li>Reference of the "Pin/Pad" Pitch (bottom side):</li>
				<div class="in-article-image-container">
					<img src="/image/pin_pitch_ruler.jpg" />
				</div>
		</ol>

		The ruler looks just as impressive when fabricated. Here's IRL pics of the fabricated PCB ruler:

		AND that was the coolest thing that I saw all month!
		<br />
    This was something artistic that provided value beyond just being an eye-candy. Which is quite rare, as almost all artistic stuff 
		is designed around the idea of making people go <i>"wow"</i> and nothing else. I can actually think of using this while working 
		on my projects or even just having this around in my work environment is frikkin' cool in itself!
