    About a month ago I began working on a porting project, a rather tedious task of
    making changes to a codebase for moving from one OS/framework/language/compiler to another.
    However, this was not my first rodeo. I had ported applications before. Going back a few months, 
    the boys wanted to run a Windows application on Docker. "So what's the issue with Windows
    docker?" you might think, "Why not just run the app on a Windows base image?". 
    Don't flatter yourself big-brain,
    we all thought of that. The problem is that the Windows base image is proprietary and asks
    us to open our wallets, whose gonna do that amirite?<br/>This means that I had to port the app 
    from Windows to Linux. I had never seen this codebase before and I had never done "porting" 
    before. Basically I had no idea what I was getting into, and like a lamb to the slaughter 
    I just went ahead with it. (Spoiler: I'm gonna regret that.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What ensued from there was a month-long endeavor of exploration, change-documentation and 
    fighting with the C compiler to replace all of the Windows dependencies with it's Linux 
    counterparts and where there was no alternative, I was expected to write it myself (yikes).
    HOLY HELL that felt like forever. And when it was done, I threw a pizza party for my lunch 
    buddies and took a couple of days off (you have no idea how badly I needed that). When I 
    returned to office, I was relaxed. Knowing that the worst is over, I slid back into my chair 
    and attended what my lunch buddies like to call "The Daily Scum Meeting" (AKA The Daily Scrum). 
    Little did I know that I was about to be assigned yet another porting task, and then another, 
    and another. I officially came to be known as the porting guy around the block and I actually 
    got used to it... or so I thought.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For my latest session of porting agony, I was given a codebase that was no less than a 
    <b>FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND LINES LONG.</b> This app was written using the Qt framework and my 
    task was to port it from Qt5 to Qt6, 
    this meant compiling the app over and over again, running into missing symbols and looking for 
    that symbol in the "Qt5 Obsolete Classes and Members" page on the official Qt website (thanks
    Qt). After replacing the symbol, I'd be documenting the change that I made for ease of debugging.
    <b>But wait, there's more!</b> The little "quirk" here was that Qt6 does not work with C++11 
    - the version that this codebase was currently written in. So, this burning and screeching hell 
    of a codebase also had to be moved from C++11 to C++17 and if that wasn't enough to make me 
    suicidal, the compiler that they were using was MSVC 2015, one that DOES HECKING NOT fully 
    support compilation of C++17 code, so I had to use the MSVC 2019 compiler.
    In summary, I was taking this codebase:
    <ul>
      <li>From Qt5 to Qt6.</li>
      <li>From C++11 to C++17.</li>
      <li>From MSVC 2015 to MSVC 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    When I finally understood the scope, I screamed (internally) and wanted to jump out the nearest 
    window, it made me understand the importance of having suicide nets around the office buildings 
    like they do in China. But did I complain? No, I'm not a quitter. I locked-in and got to work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I configured each project in the codebase to use C++17 and the errors came in like a tsunami. 
    Thousands of errors at a time, so many bugs that you'd need to use a blowtorch to kill them all. 
    The Qt-related changes were the easy part, in fact, every time I compiled I was hoping for there 
    to only be Qt errors because I knew exactly how to mitigate them. A slightly harder issue to tackle 
    was the missing base classes from the Standard Library (STL). I learned the hard way that different 
    C++ versions also meant different Standard Libraries. This codebase used certain base classes 
    from STL of C++11 that were straight-up removed in the STL of C++17. I decided to write these 
    templates myself in a project dedicated for common utilities, so that I could just #include 
    them wherever needed. A lot of the errors were solved with just the donkey-work of explicit 
    typecasting, these errors were tedious to solve, but the show-stopper was yet to come.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the compile output of almost every project, I could see a long series of the same error repeated 
    hundreds of times. This was the final boss of this task, the Professor Moriarty, the Moby Dick, the 
    Final Karen who simply refuses to budge. Every time I compile, it spits out a barrage of the same 
    line over and over again:
    <br/>
    ```<br/>
    ‘byte’: ambiguous symbol<br/>
    could be ‘unsigned char byte’<br/>
    or ‘std::byte’<br/>
    ```
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was nothing confusing about the error itself, its very clear that the compiler is not able to 
    decide between two different definitions of the symbol 'byte' for proceeding with the compilation. 
    "Simple enough" I thought naively, forgetting the fact that it's never as simple as it seems. "I 
    can solve this with `using namespace std`", I exclaimed. And this wasn't a stupid idea by any 
    measure. If the compiler can't decide which definition to pick, a namespace is what you use to 
    narrow it down. But it didn't work! The MSVC compiler kept on bitching about the same issue. So I 
    tried using `std::byte` wherever it was called. I got fewer errors, but it still persisted. Now the 
    errors originated from the Qt6 libraries, there they were `using namespace std` and I can't just 
    waltz in there and rename all symbols to `std::byte`. As reckless as that solution may seem, a 
    rather frustrated gentleman in 
    <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/error-c2872-byte-ambiguous-symbol/93889#T-N592809">this thread</a> 
    just <b>changed the symbol name straight in the Windows SDK headers</b>, no shits given. What a legend. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately for me, before I could get to the above-mentioned level of badassery, I was joined by 
    another programmer who happened be the final piece of the puzzle. The manager to banish all the Karens, 
    the harpoon of Captain Ahab, the Sherlock who cracked the case. She sent me this Stack Overflow 
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11040133/what-does-defining-win32-lean-and-mean-exclude-exactly">link</a> 
    and it gave me exactly what I needed. Such a simple solution:
    <br/>
    ```
    <br/>
    WIN32_MEAN_AND_LEAN
    <br/>
    ```
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was the blowtorch I needed to end all bugs. And I let it rip. Everywhere. I modified the .pro 
    file of every project to #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, this is a directive to the compiler to use 
    a minimal set of header files for writing a bare-bones Windows program. This minimal set of headers 
    does not include a definition of byte and with that, the compilation was a success.
