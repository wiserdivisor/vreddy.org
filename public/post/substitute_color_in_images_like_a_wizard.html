    Last year one of my colleagues was given a task for recoloring b/w icons for all 7 colors of the rainbow.
    The task was not complicated but too monotonous. The only approach he knew was opening up each icon in Gimp, filling the black with a color using the fill tool, 
    and saving it as a PNG. This would not have been such a big deal but the icons were just too many. It was 60 icons with each of them getting recolored 7 times i.e.,
    420 iterations of recoloring (holy shit). The guy was about to reach Chinese sweatshop levels of monotony with this task, but I didn't let it happen.
    I took over the task before he could begin (with his permission) by telling him that I have a method that can finish the job within minutes. Needless to say,
    he was more than happy to hand it over to me and was more than surprised to find that I have created all the required images in less than 10 minutes. 
    <br/>
    How did I do it? Magic. <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> to be more specific.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In short, ImageMagick is a command-line tool for editing images; but this description does not do justice to it's wide range of capabilities. It is a 
    literal supertool for editing images from the terminal. As the editing is done programmatically, there is no chance of errors that you'd normally make 
    when editing an image by hand. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here I've got 10 b/w PNG icons that will be our subjects for the recoloring process. These icons only contain one color: Black, the background is transparent.
    We want to recolor them with: Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. That should give us 70 new images, 80 in total.
    <br/>
    <div class="in-article-image-container">
      <img src="/image/bw_icons.jpg" style="width:100%;" />
    </div>
    <br/>
    To substitute colors in ImageMagick we use the following command... 
    <br/>
    this example is for <span style="color:red;">Red</span>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ```
    convert input.png -fill red -colorize 100 output.png
    ```
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This will preserve the transparent pixels and make everything else red.
    With a simple nested loop in Powershell, I get everything done in one fell swoop.
    <br/>
    <div class="in-article-image-container">
      <img src="/image/substitute_color_code.jpg" style="width:100%;" />
    </div>
    <br/>
   And just like that, within minutes we have our 70 recolored images!
